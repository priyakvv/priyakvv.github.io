**Hello!** <br>

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [KÃ¸benhavns Universitet](https://geotop.math.ku.dk). <br>


My broad research interest lies in Analysis and Geometry. I am currently interested in studying classical minimal surfaces in symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. I am also interested in Spectral Geometry and Lie Groups; especially Steklove eigenvalues, the spectrum of Laplacian in general Hyperbolic Surfaces, and Symmetric Spaces.

 **Hello!** <br>
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27d50918-650b-4ac2-ac9f-2d0d5dfc8faf)



I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Københavns Universitet](https://geotop.math.ku.dk), working under [Niels Martin Møller](https://web.math.ku.dk/~nmoller/). 

My broad research interest lies in Analysis and Geometry. I am currently interested in studying classical minimal surfaces in symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. I am also interested in Spectral Geometry, especially Steklove eigenvalues, the Spectrum of Laplacian in general Hyperbolic Surfaces, and Symmetric Spaces.

**Hello!**
I will be employed as a Ph.D. student at the [University of Copenhagen](https://geotop.math.ku.dk), from November 1, 2023. <br>


My broad research interest lies in Analysis and Geometry. Currently, I am interested in the modern theory of minimal surfaces, i.e. the geometry and analysis of the relevant nonlinear partial differential equations from a geometric viewpoint. I am also interested in Spectral theory,
Theory of PDEs, and Lie Groups. Especially the spectrum of Laplacian in general Hyperbolic Spaces and Symmetric Spaces, and the inter-relations between PDEs and Lie groups.

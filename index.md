**Hello!** <br>

I will be employed as a Ph.D. student at the [University of Copenhagen](https://geotop.math.ku.dk), from November 1, 2023. <br>


My broad research interest lies in Analysis and Geometry. Currently, I am interested in the study of classical minimal surfaces in symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. I am also interested in Spectral theory, the Theory of PDEs, and Lie Groups. Especially the spectrum of Laplacian in general Hyperbolic Surfaces and Symmetric Spaces, and the relations between PDEs and Lie groups.

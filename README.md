 The research will be focused on the transfer of techniques and theorems from the corresponding vast supply of classical results for minimal surfaces and into the new soliton setting.

- Master's Thesis: "Spectrum of Laplacian on Hyperbolic Surfaces"
  
 The main goal of my Master's thesis was  to obtain a complete understanding of the spectrum of the Laplacian on hyperbolic surfaces of infinite area. We began with the study of the upper half-plane,  hyperbolic surfaces, hyperbolic ends, and decompositions of the spectrum. Later we defined the Laplacian on an arbitrary manifold and discussed one of the important theorems: "The Laplacian on a complete Riemannian manifold is essentially self-adjoint”. Finally, we described the spectrum for the Upper half plane and the characterizations of the essential and the discrete spectrum on hyperbolic surfaces.
